# DAY 20 NOTES

## Datatypes
There are different types of data namely;
 - numeric(discrete, continuous) and
 - non-numeric(grades, categorical) type 
 - discrete and
 - continuous variable

Label columns- which we intend to predict
Feature columns - input based on which predictions are to be made.

## Two types of model:
If continuous datatypes are to be predicted, **REGRESSION MODEL**
If discrete variables are used, **CLASSIFICATION MODEL**
If label is present, it is supervised learning. Two models in supervised learning are classification and regression models.
Eg:
- classification: whether it will rain or not tmrw.
- regression : how much amt of rain can be expected.


## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS: For Visualization
Plots different graphs and infer
matplotlib, seaborn are some lbraries used for this purpose.
matplotlib: is mainly used for making data easy to visualize by utilizing gra[hs and charts.

## types of plots:
- line plot: time series nature of variables. how y moves wrt x.
   + import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   + plt.plot(x,y)
   + plt.xlabel(days)
   + plt.ylabel(counts)
   + plt.show()
x and y values must be sorted to do a line plot.

- bar chart:
